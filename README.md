Black-Scholes Equation Solver


This project features a Python implementation of the Black-Scholes model, including a numerical solver for the Black-Scholes partial differential equation and a Monte Carlo estimator for option pricing. It provides insights into the pricing of European options using theoretical and simulation-based methods.
